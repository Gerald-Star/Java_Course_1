# DECISION STRUCTURE

Decision structure is a programming concept that allows you to make decisions based on certain conditions. In Java, you can use the `if` statement to create decision structures. The `if` statement evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.

Types of decision structures in Java:

1. `if` statement: The `if` statement evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.

2. `if-else` statement: The `if-else` statement evaluates a condition and executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

3. `if-else if-else` statement: The `if-else if-else` statement evaluates multiple conditions and executes different blocks of code based on the conditions.

4. Nested `if` statement: You can nest `if` statements inside other `if` statements to create more complex decision structures.
